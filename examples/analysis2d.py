""" ==================== examples/analysis.py ========================== 
This example file shows how to set and run a 2d analysis for airfoils

Prerequisites: project_mgmt.py, polar_io.py
Features: 
    Set current polar
    Introduce AnalysisSettings2D class
    Define polar analysis
    Run analysis and get custom results
